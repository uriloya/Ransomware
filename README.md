# Crypy - Linux ransomware (cryptolocker)

This project is a simple cryptolocker virus implementation in python
It encrypts all of the users important files and displays a message for the user with instructions of how to decrypt the files (by paying bitcoins)
Once the payment is done the attacker can view the victims id and send the appropriate decryption key which will restore the files.

Please note this project is for learning purpose only and also be very careful as it might encrypt your files!
Use at your own risk and only on vm's
